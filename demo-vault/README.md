# Demo Vault

This is a sample Obsidian vault to preview how garmin-sync-obsidian works.
It contains 94 dummy workout entries spanning 2024–2026.

## How to open

1. Open Obsidian → **Open another vault** → **Open folder as vault**
2. Select this `demo-vault` folder
3. Install the two required community plugins:
   - **Dataview** — queries the workout notes
   - **Heatmap Calendar** — renders the GitHub-style calendar
4. Open **Workout routine.md** to see the calendar

> The plugins need to be installed once; after that they are auto-enabled
> because `.obsidian/community-plugins.json` already lists them.
